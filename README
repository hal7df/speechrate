INSTALL:

On your Android phone, go to Settings>Security and check the "Unknown Sources" option. You'll need to have that 
checked to install this app.

Go to the Google Play store, and download & install the app "Ministro II" (if you haven't already). This app is 
libraries only, so it will not show up in your apps directory.

Once you've done that, navigate to the "release" folder and download the file "SpeechRate-stable-<version>.apk". Once it's done, open the "Downloads" app,
and open with App Installer. It will only take a moment to install.

If you have not used Ministro on your phone before, it will ask to download extra libraries. Let it do this -- it may 
take some time. Once it's done, the app should work.
