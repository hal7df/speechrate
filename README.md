==========

An Android app created as an experiment to study the use of filler words in speeches. Built on Qt technology.

Ever wondered how much you use filler words during a presentation? This app is designed especially for that! It allows you to count how many times you use words such as 'like', 'um', pauses, or repetitions you make in a presentation. It also can time you, and give you an average frequency.
